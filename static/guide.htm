   <h4>Installing signatures</h4>
   Information on signature development and syntax can be found below. Once you
   have something ready to go you can use signatures from this utility in DROID
   and Siegfried.
   <br/><br/>
   <h5>DROID</h5>
   DROID signatures need to be installed in the <code>.droid6</code> folder in
   either Windows or Linux. On Windows this folder will be in <code>%HOMEPATH%</code>,
   e.g. <code>\user\{{username}}</code>. And in Linux <code>/home/{{username]}/.droid6</code>.
   Standard signatures are installed in <code>signature_files</code> and container signature
   files are installed in <code>container_sigs</code>.
   <br/><br/>
   When you run the DROID user interface you can navigate to <code><b>tools -> preferences</b></code> to
   then select your new development signature files.
   <br/><br/>
   <h5>Siegfried</h5>
   Similarly for Siegfried, there is a siegfried home directory. Using the above
   pattern, the siegfried example on Linux will be: <code>/home/{{username}}/siegfried</code>.
   <br/><br/>
   You simply need to have the two Signature files in this directory and then
   run the following using Siegfried's <code>roy</code> tool:
   <br/><br/>
   <pre class="nospace">$ roy build -droid {{your-signature-file-name}}.xml \
    -noreports \
    -container {{your-container-signature-file-name}}.xml</pre>.
   <h5>A brief note about container signatures</h5>
   If you are developing a container signature for a format already recorded in
   PRONOM you only need to worry about creating and using a container signature
   file from this utility. It is only for novel formats you may consider writing
   a standard signature file too.

   <h4>Standard signatures</h4>

   <br/><br/>
   <p>
   In PRONOM, an internal signature is composed of one or more byte
   sequences, each comprising a continuous sequence of hexadecimal
   bytes values and, optionally, regular expressions. A signature byte
   sequence is modelled by describing its starting position within a
   bitstream and its value.
   <br/><br/>
   The starting position can be one of two basic types:
   <br/><br/>
   <b>Absolute:</b> The byte sequence starts at a fixed position within the
   bitstream. The position is described as an offset from either the
   beginning or the end of the bitstream. The byte sequence can
   therefore be located by moving to the specified offset, counting
   from either the beginning of file or end of file position. If
   counting from either the EOF position, the offset is to the final
   byte in the sequence.
   <br/><br/>
   <b>Variable:</b> The byte sequence can start at any offset within the
   bitstream. The byte sequence can be located by examining the entire
   bitstream.
   <br/><br/>
   The value of the byte sequence is defined as a sequence of
   hexadecimal values, optionally incorporating any of the following
   regular expressions:
   <br/><br/>

   <dl>

   <dt>
   <b>??:</b> wildcard matching any pair of hexadecimal values (i.e. a
   single byte).
   </dt>
   <br/>
   <dd>
   e.g.: 0x0A FF ?? FE would match 0x0A FF 6C FE or 0x0A FF 11 FE.
   </dd>
   <br/>

   <dt>
   <b>*:</b> wildcard matching any number of bytes (0 or more).
   </dt>
   <br/>
   <dd>
   e.g.: 0x0A FF * FE would match 0x0A FF 6C FE or 0x0A FF 6C 11 FE.
   </dd>
   <br/>
   <dt>
   <b>{n}:</b> wildcard matching n bytes, where n is an integer.
   </dt>
   <br/>
   <dd>
   e.g.: 0x1C 20 {2} 4E 12 would match 0x1C 20 FF 15 4E 12.
   </dd>
   <br/>
   <dt>
   <b>{m-n}:</b> wildcard matching between m-n bytes inclusive, where
   m and n are integers or ‘*’.
   </dt>
   <br/>
   <dd>
   e.g.: 0x03 {1-2} 4D would match 0x03 3C 4D or 0x03 3C 88 4D.
   <br/><br/>
   e.g.: 0x03 {2-*} 4D would match 0x03 3C 88 4D or 0x03 3C 88 3F 4D.
   </dd>
   <br/>
   <dt>
   <b>(a|b):</b> wildcard matching one from a list of values (e.g. a
   or b), where each value is a hexadecimal byte sequence of arbitrary
   length containing no wildcards.
   </dt>
   <br/>
   <dd>
   e.g.: 0x0E (FF|FE) 17 would match 0x0E FF 17 or 0x0E FE 17.
   </dd>
   <br/>
   <dt>
   <b>[a:b]:</b> wildcard matching any sequence of bytes which lies
   lexicographically between a and b, inclusive (where both a and b
   are byte sequences of the same length, containing no wildcards, and
   where a is less than b).  The endian-ness of a and b are the same
   as the endian-ness of the signature as a whole.
   </dt>
   <br/>
   <dd>
   e.g. 0xFF [09:0B] FF would match 0xFF 09 FF, 0xFF 0A FF or 0xFF 0B
   FF.
   </dd>
   <br/>
   <dt>
   <b>[!a]:</b> wildcard matching any sequence of bytes other than a
   itself (where a is a byte sequence containing no wildcards).
   </dt>
   <br/>
   <dd>
   e.g. 0xFF [!09] FF would match 0xFF 0A FF, but not 0xFF 09 FF.

   Identification Using PRONOM and DROID Page 9 of 33
   </dd>
   <br/>
   <dt>
   <b>[!a:b]:</b> wildcard matching any sequence of bytes which does
   not lie lexicographically between a and b, inclusive (where a and
   b are both byte sequences of the same length, containing no
   wildcards, and where a is less than b).
   </dt>
   <br/>
   <dd>
   e.g. 0xFF [!01:02] FF would match 0xFF 00 FF and 0xFF 03 FF, but
   not 0xFF 01 FF or 0xFF 02 FF.
   </dd>
   </dl>

   Note: In the examples above, spaces are included between byte
   values for reasons of clarity, but are omitted in actual byte
   sequence values. The signature is processed left-to-right if the
   signature is measured relative to BOF and right-to-left if measured
   relative to EOF. The endian-ness of the signature is only relevant
   for sequences inside square brackets. A byte sequence must contain
   a fixed subsequence of at least one byte between each occurrence of
   ‘*’, or between the beginning or end of the sequence and an
   occurrence of ‘*’. Thus, sequences of the following form are not
   permitted:
   <br/><br/>
   [BOF] (a|b)*…
   <br/><br/>
   …*(a|b) [EOF]
   <br/><br/>
   …*(a|b)*...
